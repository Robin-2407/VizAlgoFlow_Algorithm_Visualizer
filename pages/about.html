            <h1>About VizAlgoFlow</h1>
            <p>Enhancing Understanding Through Visualization</p>
        </header>

        <h2>What is VizAlgoFlow?</h2>
        <p>VizAlgoFlow is an interactive platform designed to visualize various algorithms and data structures, making
            complex concepts accessible to learners and practitioners in computer science. The goal of this project is
            to provide a comprehensive understanding of how algorithms work through real-time visualization, allowing
            users to observe the process step by step.</p>

        <h2>Why VizAlgoFlow?</h2>
        <p>Algorithms are the backbone of computer science, and understanding how they function is essential for both
            aspiring developers and seasoned programmers. With VizAlgoFlow, we aim to demystify these concepts through
            dynamic visualizations that bring algorithms to life.</p>

        <h2>Key Features:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Multi-Page Structure:</strong> Organized into separate pages for various sorting and searching
                algorithms, allowing users to focus without feeling overwhelmed.</li>
            <li><strong>Interactive Visualizations:</strong> Users can input their own datasets, visually represented,
                observing step-by-step transformations as the algorithm executes.</li>
            <li><strong>Customizable Inputs:</strong> Flexibility to generate random arrays, specify the number of
                elements, and include duplicates.</li>
            <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Fully functional on all devices, designed with a mobile-first
                approach.</li>
            <li><strong>Dark and Light Themes:</strong> Supports both themes to enhance user experience and
                accessibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Algorithm Descriptions and Complexity Analysis:</strong> Each algorithm page includes a
                comprehensive description and complexity analysis to aid understanding.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Understanding Data Structures and Algorithms:</h2>
        <p>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are fundamental concepts that every programmer must master. They form
            the basis for writing efficient code and solving complex problems. Understanding these concepts allows
            developers to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Optimize Performance:</strong> Choosing the right data structure can significantly reduce time
                and space complexity in applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Improve Problem Solving:</strong> A solid grasp of algorithms helps in breaking down problems
                and devising efficient solutions.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhance Software Development:</strong> Efficient algorithms are crucial for applications that
                handle large datasets, ensuring they perform well under load.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Data Structures:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Arrays:</strong> A collection of elements identified by index or key, allowing for efficient
                access.</li>
            <li><strong>Linked Lists:</strong> A sequential collection of elements, where each element points to the
                next, allowing for efficient insertions and deletions.</li>
            <li><strong>Stacks:</strong> A Last In First Out (LIFO) structure, used for function calls, backtracking,
                and more.</li>
            <li><strong>Queues:</strong> A First In First Out (FIFO) structure, ideal for scheduling and resource
                sharing.</li>
            <li><strong>Trees:</strong> A hierarchical structure ideal for representing relationships and hierarchies.
            </li>
        </ul>

        // you can call the updateTheme function here as well on page load.
